# Features

* Credential/account system uses the %USERNAME% to sign the user into their correct account. No passwords required! (If the Windows %username% isn't tied to any account on the board, the user is signed into a Guest account with no permissions)

* A random-user-select ability, selects someone random from the board. We used it to draw straws for 'undesirable' tasks.  

* Multiple themes!
